# telco-customer-churn

The notebook "telco_customer_churn.ipynb" tracks a fictional telco company's customer churn based on a variety of possible factors. It elaborates processes from data/library imports, data exploration to data visualization, data preprocessing and machine learning model evaluation and predictions. 

Customer churn jeopardizes a firm â€™s profitability. Various strategies can be implemented to eliminate customer churn. The best way to avoid customer churn is for a company to truly know its customers. This includes identifying customers who are at risk of churning and working to improve their satisfaction. Improving customer service is, of course, at the top of the priority for tackling this issue. Building customer loyalty through relevant experiences and specialized service is another strategy to reduce customer churn. Some firms survey customers who have already churned to understand their reasons for leaving in order to adopt a proactive approach to avoid future customer churn.
